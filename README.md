A simple Python script to extract financial information from statements of accounts in .pdf format. To parse the .pdf, this script needs the latest Version of [Java](https://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp) to run.

Currently supported banks (more to be added soon):
- ING 

Simply drag all your files into the 'files' folder an run 'extraction.py'. The script will output one Excel file per Month of data it can find. 
The Excel file and the cashflow model itself is build by [Felix KÃ¶hne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-k%C3%B6hne/).
